Platform specific makefiles are included for historic reasons but they are 
not maintained any more. Please use cmake to generate native projects and makefiles.

Note: the library is still named libmusicxml2. It doesn't refer to the version 
number but to the significant architecture change that has been introduced with 
the version 2 of the library. The name has been kept for compatibility reasons 
and because there is no change from architecture viewpoint.
