MusicXML Library

Version 3.00
- update to MusicXML version 3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.10
- new xmlfactory interface
- correct a bug in xml parser (element content = '=')

Version 2.00
- new version supporting MusicXML version 2, completely redesigned,
  NOT compatible with the previous versions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10
- correct a bug in musicxml to guido export: \empty generated for empty measures (multiple voices)
- correct a bug in transposevisitor: repeated keys were generating diatonic shifts
- lexer change to correctly handle " and ' as quotes

Version 1.09
- correct bug in wavy-line parsing  

Version 1.08 
- bug in offsets management (<direction> elements) corrected
- XML2Guido visitor modified to generate positions (default)
  controled via generatePositions (bool state)

Version 1.07 
- Bug in TUnrolledVisitor fixed (no section to add when "repeat" on the first bar)
- crescendo and dimunuendo tags exported to guido
- \clef \key \meter \repeatBegin tags order enforced by the XML2Guido visitor

Version 1.061
- parser memory leak correction

Version 1.06
- parser modified to accept PI (processing instructions)

Version 1.05
- bug in musicxml to guido conversion corrected (introduced by v1.04): crash 
  with single measure scores.

Version 1.04
- bug in musicxml to guido conversion corrected: occured when the last last 
  duration of a voice (or part) was equal to the first duration of the next 
  voice, provided that this duration was not the guido default 1/4 duration. In 
  this case first next voice duration was incorrectly set to the default 1/4 
  duration.

Version 1.03
- transposing diatonic interval forced when null in transpose element and |steps| > 1

Version 1.02
- new TTransposeVisitor for dynamic score transposition
- add a getDuration method in TMidiContextVisitor
- correct TUnrolledVisitor in GetEndingNum and GetRepeatTimes 
- modification of musicxml to guido conversion: 
	incomplete measures are not any more filled with "empty"
	barlines generation corrected (inhibited before a repeat begin)

Version 1.01
- correct TUnrolledVisitor for repeat end ending bar detection (IsRepeat and IsEnding methods)

Version 1.00

- crash bug corrected in TMusicXMLVisitor::visite ( SScoreTimewise& elt )
- correct Lyric and print element export, add elision management
- correct parser for elements with type attribute

Version 0.96
- Add an empty constructor in TMidiContextVisitor: when there is no "tpq" value, the value in 
the XML file will be used.  
- MusicXML elements implementation: grouping, features 
- Parsing of rehearsal, pedal, damp, damp-all, eyeglasses, other-direction, print, glissando,
slide, arpeggiate, non-arpeggiate, other-articulation, lyric.
- sound element supports version 1 attributes 
- MusicXML version changed to 1.0 in MusicXML header

Version 0.94
- Guido export: support of daCapo, dalSegno, fine, etc...
- bug corrected in TUnrolledVisitor when a repeat sign occurs at the last measure
- bug corrected in TUnrolledVisitor when computing sections for mapping
- trill-start, trill-step and two-notes-turn supported via conversion objects TrillStart and TrillStep
- MusicXML elements implementation (to be completed): staff-details, measure-style, rehearsal, pedal, 
  damp, damp-all, eyeglasses, other-direction, print, glissando, slide, technical,arpeggiate, 
  non-arpeggiate, other-notation, other-articulation, lyric, figured-bass

Version 0.93
- visitors are not any more smartable
- TRolledVisitor and TUnrolledVisitor exported (for Windows Visual C++)
- TMidiContextVisitor added
- constructor and destructors moved from inline to library - this is intended
  to catch the runtime library problem on windows.
- correct the TMeasure::getNumber method that was incorrectly resturning -1 when "implicit" attribute was set to yes.
Since measure number is required, TMeasure::getNumber now returns the measure number in any case.

Version 0.92

- breathMark guido tag generated (but not handled in guido engine)

Version 0.91
- In TPitch class, correct MIDIPitch method : the returned pitch was one octave below the correct value.
- bimap objects provide a size() method
- TSlurs and TTie objects now accept visitors: only the base class TTieSlur was previously implementing accept.
- getDuration method for partwise measures <TPWMeasure> accept a voice selector.
